# Flask REST API

This is a simple REST API built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The API provides endpoints to manage resources (you can specify what kind of resources your API handles, e.g., users, products, etc.).

## Features

- RESTful architecture
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing resources
- JSON response format
- Authentication and authorization (if implemented)
- Easy to deploy and integrate into other systems

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-RESTful (or other Flask extensions if used, like Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-SQLAlchemy)
- Any other dependencies you use (e.g., libraries for database management, data validation)

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
